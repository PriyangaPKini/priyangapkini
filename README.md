## About Me

👋 Hello! I'm Priyanga P Kini, a B.Tech computer science graduate of Model Engineering College, Kochi. I am passionate about creating useful and user-friendly software. My curiosity to dig into anything that feels like “magic” is what drove me to backend engineering. Currently, honoring my craft at [nilenso](nilenso.com).

## 📋 Experience

**Engineer - nilenso**

Simple.org (Nov 2021- Sept 2024)

July, 2021 - Present

Worked on [Simple.org](http://simple.org/), an open source Ruby on Rails app that backed the [Simple.org](http://simple.org/) mobile app, and served a web dashboard for health administrators. I also extensively interfaced with stakeholders including health administrators at the WHO and ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research), Program Managers in South Asia and Africa and our application’s primary users (healthcare workers - nurses and doctors in government health programs) to gather requirements and prioritize work.
